    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Last updated: September 12, 2018</p>
    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the LIVE4 GoPro
        mobile application (the "Service") operated by VideoGorillas LLC ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
        These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the
        terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>
    <h2>Communications</h2>
    <p>By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional
        materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these
        communications
        from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.</p>
    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in
        advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or
        annual basis,
        depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions
        unless you cancel it or VideoGorillas LLC cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
        your
        online account management page or by contacting VideoGorillas LLC customer support team.</p>
    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You
        shall provide VideoGorillas LLC with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address,
        state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
        information, you
        automatically authorize VideoGorillas LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to
        any such payment instruments.</p>
    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, VideoGorillas LLC will issue an electronic invoice
        indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding
        to the
        billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
    <h2>Free Trial</h2>
    <p>VideoGorillas LLC may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of
        time ("Free Trial").</p>
    <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
    <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by
        VideoGorillas LLC until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you
        cancelled your
        Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription
        you
        have selected.</p>
    <p>At any time and without notice, VideoGorillas LLC reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions
        of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
    <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
    <p>VideoGorillas LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the
        Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing
        Cycle.</p>
    <p>VideoGorillas LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give
        you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your
        agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by VideoGorillas LLC on a case-by-case basis and
        granted in sole discretion of VideoGorillas LLC.</p>
