#Why I cant lock screen when streaming from an iPhone?

When you are streaming LIVE on iOS, you can not leave the app while the stream is running. Once you click the home button or lock the screen - notification that stream will be terminated in 42 seconds pops up (if you allowed the app to send you notifications, of course). 

The thing is that iOS does not let the app transcode video on the background. When you are shutting the app, after 60 seconds all the related processes pause. If you want to keep the stream going, you have nothing to do but leave the app open and do not lock the screen. 

If your activity requires long streams with the locked screen - please use LIVE4 on Android device instead.
