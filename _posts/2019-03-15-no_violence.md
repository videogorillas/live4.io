When we were designing and developing LIVE4 app, first of all we thought of people who are into active sports, 
music and everyone else to bring joy and happiness to people all over the world. For people who want to share 
their important life events with their friends and family. People who wish to spread good emotions with social 
networks and do that as easy as possible. Considering that responsibility of the live stream lies completely 
and solely on the person who initiates it, we were always afraid of one thing. And it happened today.

LIVE4 team was shocked with news about tragic events that had happened in Christchurch, New Zealand.  

Let us make it very clear - we condemn actions of these horrible persons. We offer our deepest most heartfelt 
condolences to the families and friends of the victims.

LIVE4 has zero tolerance towards violence. We will do whatever is humanly possible for it to never happen again.
