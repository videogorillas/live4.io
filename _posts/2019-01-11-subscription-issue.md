**Q: I switched to a yearly subscription but still can’t switch off LIVE4 logo and signature line in my streams.
Why? What should I do?**

###	How does it usually happen?

   1. A user subscribes for 1-month or 3-months subscription and free trial begins.

   2. A user changes subscription to ‘Yearly’ in phone settings still being on a free trial

### Why it happens?

At the moment, LIVE4 app is not able to monitor and recognize subscription changes made outside of the app when
user is on a free trial. We are working to resolve  the issue.

### PLEASE NOTE

   - If you want to try out PRO Features like LIVE4 logo and signature line switch-off during the trial period,
   pay attention that it’s only possible with a **Yearly Subscription** free trial!

   - If you have chosen **1-month** or **3-months subscription**, *the only* feature you get during a free trial period is
    streaming to business pages and groups.

   - If you make any changes to your subscription during the trial period (either cancellation or switching to a
    Yearly subscription) the changes won’t take effect until trial period expires. Your free trial expires exactly
    in two weeks from the day you signed up for it.

### What can I do now?

The only thing we can currently suggest, is wait until the end of your trial period. Once, the first Yearly
subscription payment will come through, you will be able to use our PRO features (logo + signature line switch-off).

We continuously work on app stability improvement and try our best to ensure all the important moments of your
streaming to get recorded and delivered to your viewers. If you have questions, concerns or ideas how to make LIVE4
better, do not hesitate to contact us at [support@live4.io](mailto:support@live4.io) or join the discussion at
