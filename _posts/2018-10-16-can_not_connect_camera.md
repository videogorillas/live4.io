**Q**: We were unable to connect to your GoPro. Camera not found. Not connect. Not connecting after everything was done. Seems like i cant connect my camera. This time I can't connect completely the go pro.

 
**A**: Looks like your wifi disconnects from GoPro because of some setting on the phone which doesn't let it keep connected to a network that doesn't provide internet.
Please check that your phone is connected to the camera's WiFi, that password is correct, your camera is turned on and any VPN is turned off.
Seems like your phone is connected to the internet Wi-Fi and not connected to the camera's Wi-Fi.
Seems like you entered wrong password to the camera's Wi-Fi or Smart network switch is turned on.
Check your advanced wifi settings. there's can be a setting which disconnects wifi if it doesn't have internet. turn this setting off.
