Within the last few years live streaming has significantly changed the content development in the online world. One
of the most popular live streaming services like Facebook Live, generates [more than 760 years of watch time](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/)
daily and its live videos get 3x times more engagement than regular videos shared on this platform. Thus,  missing
out on livestreaming is not an option today.

However, many people still struggle not knowing how to start their first stream, what do they need for it and how
to integrate livestreaming into their business’ content plan.

Luckily, all these questions have their answers :) So lets cover a step-by-step instruction on what to do if you
are new to livestreaming.

### 1. Start with the essentials: hardware and internet

Of course there’s no need to get expensive professional equipment headfirst to go live for the first time. Yet your
streams will definitely look better if it’s not going to be a smartphone.

The most important things to pay attention to when choosing equipment for streaming live are sound quality and picture
stability, ensuring which should be your primary goal. For example, a GoPro HERO7 line has very good built-in
microphone and stabilization which makes it one of the best GoPro cameras for live video streaming at the moment.
Though its predecessors like GoPro HERO6 and GoPro HERO5 have quite decent characteristics too, considering an
additional audio gear like external microphone won’t be extra.

Also, before starting your stream double-check if your cellular connection is good and stable. For that, keep your
phone not further than 3 meters (10ft) away from the camera and check your upload speed by using any existing speed
test app. Usually, 3 Mbps upload capacity is sufficient for a stable live session. Pleasant bonus for our Android
users: now you can check the speed of your internet within the LIVE4 app ;)

### 2. Always prepare and plan ahead

First of all, remember that preparation is key to success, whether you choose to stream a one-off event like a
lecture, conference or a weekly show. Take some time, get a tripod for your cam, find a place with good lighting
and no distracting background sounds and plan what you are going to say. Some professionals even recommend to first
go live on platforms were you don’t have much followers. That may help you reduce the stress and get to experience
what live stream actually is. Even though laid-back vibe of the stream is fun, but you’ll look more professional if
you are prepared.

Second thing you need to keep in mind - promote your stream beforehand. Try to advertise your online event, webinar,
etc. to build viewers’ anticipation. Ensure this way that your audience know about the online event and is going to
watch it.

Third, is a little tip for those who struggle to choose content for their live shows. Make your livestream a part
of your content plan! It may be way easier to come up with a topic for your show when it is a part of a bigger plan.
Additionally, due to the fact that live streams create the feeling of being involved, connected with the world and
excited, the effect of it could be much better than from any other method of your online marketing.

### 3. What to stream?

The thing you should keep in mind when generating ideas for your live events, content should valuable, educative,
entertaining and professional. And it’s great if you can combine all of these features together! Don’t be afraid to
experiment with topics for your broadcasts. Here are a few ideas for your livestreaming events.

Without doubt, behind-the-scenes streams are best at creating excitement and spurring the viewers’ interest. For
example, as you get ready to go on stage, run a webinar or open up some secrets of the technology process of your
company.

Another popular idea is to broadcast real-time events which are important to your business, such as conferences,
meetings, presentations, etc. But if you also want to build trust with your customers, show the “human face” of
your employees and go live when you are having some team-building event.

At last, have a Q&A session and answer openly the most popular questions or discuss the hottest topics in your
field. Feel free to be creative in making up a new subject for your live talk-shows! However, if you struggle to
come up with the first livestream topic, use one of the following:

 - Discuss what you learned recently, what inspires you or share the progress on your goals

 - Share your life or business philosophy with the viewers

 - Offer advice or tips about business, life, marketing, finance, etc

 - Share the story about the mistakes you’ve made and what you learned from them

 - Introduce a case study based on the success of one of your clients using your service/product (with their
 permission)

 - Your biggest life/business obstacle and how you overcame it

 - Your favorite tools in work to make your life easier
