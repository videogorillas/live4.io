### Audio 

Also does this app have the ability to run simultaneously with the pioneer DJM-REC app¿ or is there a way to use external audio within live 4¿
 iOS does not let apps fully run in the background, so streaming will work only while you are located on the streaming screen. But you can do this on Android. 
Regarding the external audio - you can attach a mic to your GoPro via a special adapter https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-3-5mm-Adapter-Official-Accessory/dp/B00A3MY7L8
