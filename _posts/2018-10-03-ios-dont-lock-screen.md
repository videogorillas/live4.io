### Stream terminates when I lock screen or go to the home screen.

Unfortunately iOS makes streaming in background or with locked screen very hard but we are working on it. Read on to learn more.

**Q**: After 45 seconds stream froze and never got connection back. 

My LIVE4 connection with Facebook keeps dropping after starting the live recordings. Seems like it last until I shut off my phone screen. 

LIVE4 would disconnect from the camera when my phone locked.

My live stream interrupts for no reason after opening home screen.

Today almost every time I went live it would drop the stream. What are some of the parameters that kick it out. Does having the GoPro app running help with better connection?

I have a problem that is not having image if I click the on/off button of my iPhone. The steaming pauses. Is it supposed to be like that? Can’t I put the phone in my pocket and continue filming and streaming? 

Do I really need to have the screen open?

I tried going live tonight and using my hero 5 tonight. Unfortunately after 45 seconds it froze and never got connection back. I was racing karts and had my GoPro on my helmet and my phone in my pocket. The GoPro app still recorded everything which was nice. 

Not sure why it would have froze unless my cell signal was not very strong. However others went live with just their phones on Facebook and had a solid cell connection all night. 

I’m using the app in my Canyoning adventures.

Does that sound familiar to you?
 
**A**: We realize full well that it is very convenient to keep your phone in your pocket and GoPro mounted somewhere, this is what GoPros are for anyway. 
We use GoPros for skydiving, cycling and racing, so we know the struggle.

Have you locked your iPhone or pressed Home button? Unfortunately iOS makes streaming in background or with locked screen very hard but we are working on it.
Apple does not allow any application (not just LIVE4) to work with video when the application is not on screen. 
So yes when you lock the screen or press home button LIVE4 is being stopped by iOS.
The most frequent reason for stream interrupt on iOS is when you lock your phones screen.
iOS kills any app that works with video as soon as it gets off the screen.

LIVE4 is sending notification when the app is entering background to let you know your stream is going to stop soon. And lets you know what happened if you missed or disabled notifications.

We are working non-stop to make streaming with locked screen possible, but can't promise anything since it's Apples policy.

As a workaround we can recommend using our Android app. Which you can find on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vg.goprolive&referrer=utm_source%3Dlive4_web%26utm_medium%3Dblog_ioslock%26utm_term%3Dcampaign1%26utm_content%3Dblog_ioslock_link%26utm_campaign%3Dblog_campaign). 

Here is what it looks like when screen is locked on Android
