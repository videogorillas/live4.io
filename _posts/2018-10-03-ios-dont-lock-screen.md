### Stream terminates when I lock screen or go to the home screen.

Unfortunately iOS makes impossible streaming in background or with locked screen but we are working on it. Read on to learn more.

**Q**: After 45 seconds stream froze and never got connection back. 
My LIVE4 connection with Facebook keeps dropping after starting the live recordings. Seems like it last until I shut off my phone screen. 
It would disconnect from the camera when my phone locked.
My live stream interrupts for no reason after opening home screen.
Today almost every time I went live it would drop the stream. What are some of the parameters that kick it out. Does having the GoPro app running help with better connection?
I have a problem that is not having image if I click the on/off button of my iPhone. The steaming pauses. Is it supposed? Canâ€™t I put the phone on my pocket and continue filming and streaming? 
I really need to have the screen open?

**A**: Have you locked your iPhone? Unfortunately iOS makes impossible streaming in background or with locked screen but we are working on it.
Unfortunately Apple doesn't allow any application to work with video when the application is not on screen. So yes when you lock the screen live4 is being stopped by iOS.
So yes when you lock the screen or press home button LIVE4 is being stopped by iOS.
The most frequent reason for stream interrupt on iOS is when you lock your phones screen.
iOS kills any app that works with video as soon as it gets off the screen.
So pressing home button should give the same effect.
