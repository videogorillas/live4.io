**Q: How to stream to 30+ platforms with one GoPro cam?**

**A: Easy!** 

1. Get the new version of LIVE4 app.

2. Log in with Restream account. If you don't have one, you can create it in 30 seconds. We tested.

3. Connect your iPhone or Android phone to your GoPro.

4. Setup platforms you want to stream to: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter (Periscope), Twitch, UStream, VK, 
Mixer, LinkedIn...

5. Start your stream.

6. Watch your friends and followers comments from all platforms at once!

We've been working hard to make that happen. Now we hope you can enjoy it as well as we do.
Show what you've got to as wide audience as you want.

Have a nice multistreaming!

We are continuously working on app stability improvements and trying our best to ensure that all the important
moments you stream  are recorded and delivered to your viewers. If you have questions, concerns or ideas how to
