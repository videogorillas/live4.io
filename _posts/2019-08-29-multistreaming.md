We've been asked so many times if LIVE4 can stream to YouTube or Twitter besides Facebook.

And now we can say, definitely yes. But not only to YouTube and Twitter!

From now on, with LIVE4 you can stream to 30+ platforms: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, 
UStream, VK, Mixer, LinkedIn... You name it.

And that's not all we are proud for. You really don't have to choose if you want 
a Facebook stream or a YouTube stream. LIVE4 proposition: have it all at the same time. Simultaneously!

That's how it works: you download the latest LIVE4 app from AppStore or Google Play. 
Then, log into Restream account. Restream is a great service that we have recently integrated with 
to make multistreaming from GoPro possible. 
As soon as you set up channels you want to stream to, it's done!

That's it. Wit a touch of a button, your stream is sent simultaneously to as many platforms, 
as you wish. No limits. 

Almost all popular GoPros are supported as always.

Have a nice multistreaming!
