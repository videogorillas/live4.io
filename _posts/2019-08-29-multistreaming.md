**How to stream to 30 platforms at once having only one GoPro cam?**

Easy! Get the new version of LIVE4 app.

Log in with Restream account. If you don't have one, you can create it in 30 seconds. We tested.

Connect your iPhone or Android to your GoPro.

Setup platforms you want to stream to: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter (Periscope), Twitch, UStream, VK, 
Mixer, LinkedIn...

Press the Red Button.

Watch your friends and followers comments from all platforms at once!

We've been working hard to make that happen. Now we hope you can enjoy it as well as we do.
Show what you've got to as wide audience as you want.

Have a nice multistreaming!
