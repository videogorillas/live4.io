It won’t be a surprise to hear that today’s market is very competitive. Businesses are constantly searching for new
ways to reach their audience and marketers strive to improve their content strategies for the same reason. However,
if you run a business you also need to be conscious of two things: time and money. So, naturally, you have to ask
yourself the following question: is it worth investing time and money to include livestreaming in your marketing mix?
Our answer is yes! And in this article we will explain the benefits of live video streaming to Facebook using the
LIVE4 GoPro app and how this tactic may improve your ROI from live events and business in general.

### A few words about ROI

First of all, let’s understand what ROI is.

**ROI**, meaning **return on investment**, is a common ratio that evaluates the efficiency of your investment(s). It is
estimated by dividing your net profit by the cost of your investment. This ratio enables you to gauge the
profitability of many things in your business like equipment investment, pricing policies and even marketing
strategy. Even though estimating marketing techniques’ value may seem tricky, the ROI from it is still quite a
real thing.

### How can businesses make money from live streaming?

There are multiple ways to ensure financial profit from livestreaming. In general, these can either be direct methods,
such as pay-per-view or subscription options; or indirect methods, which usually are far less obvious.

Some of the most popular indirect methods for monetizing broadcasts include the placing of ads at the bottom of a
stream, sponsored brand placement during a live session and revenue paid proportional to a website’s traffic.

However, not many people understand that live-streaming isn’t just a single use good, but a powerful marketing tool
for generating long-term recurring sales. As we’ve already mentioned, livestreaming is a perfect technique for
improving your business’ ROI, and here is what the stats say about it:

 - Livestreaming captures about ⅔ of global internet traffic – with this number expected to jump to 80% by the end of 2020

 - [73% of b2b businesses](https://www.insivia.com/50-must-know-stats-about-video-marketing-2016/) report positive
 effects on their ROI from video content in marketing campaigns

 - Live video frequently leads to better conversions on retail websites

 - Companies using video [get 41% more web traffic](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/top-video-marketing-statistics#sm.0001agz8fnm7qcuby3m2fy7vd2qou)
 from searches

 - Native video uploads to [Facebook have 10 times the reach](https://www.slideshare.net/AdelieStudios/adelie-studios-top16videomarketingstatistics2016-56658453)
 of shared links on Youtube or any other streaming platform

 - Up to 80% of people are already watching live streams on Facebook regularly

However, you may now be asking how do you encourage your audience to watch a live session? Where should you stream
to for your campaign to have the greatest impact? We’ve got the answers!

### Which platform for livestreaming should you use or why LIVE4 recommends Facebook

You won’t be the first person to expect sales by the end of one month of marketing. However, keep in mind that this
isn’t the case for most businesses. ROI takes time and a number of repetitive activities before you’ll notice the
effect of your marketing.

Now that you’ve decided to include live streaming in your content plan, you may spend a long time choosing an
appropriate platform for that. But why not make your life easier and just share it on Facebook? Here’s our few
reasons why you should consider it for your broadcasts based on the experience and observations.

1. First of all, one undeniable thing that Facebook has, is reach. There are [more than one billion active Facebook
users](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/facebook-2-billion-users/) from around the world, which means millions of
potential viewers. It makes Facebook one of the best platforms for advertising, personal branding or building your
brand’s presence. By using live video content you can reach tons of people and generate more traffic to your page
or website.

2. Another reason why it is so good - no need to draw and grow your audience on a separate platform! One billion
users are already there, which means it’s easier to advertise your stream within it.

3. Facebook always notifies all your followers and friends that your live has started, and even if they logged in
after the end of it, they are going to see it in their feed and have access to it.

4. As for users’ behaviour, Facebook Live videos generate 3x times more audience engagement and on top of that,
people spend 3x more time watching lives than regular videos!

5. After the live session, you can easily archive the stream on your page and continue getting views.

### So how do you actually grow ROI from livestreaming?

Of course, it may be hard to picture the influence of livestreaming on your revenue stream initially. So for better
understanding, imagine your business is selling tickets to a live event but also broadcasts it online. According to
statistics, digital audiences of webinar-style livestreams are usually 20-70x times the size of real-live event
audiences. This means that livestreaming taps into the vast viewership available online and extends your reach well
beyond what was possible before.

Another proven fact is that almost 70% of people who watched a broadcast may purchase a ticket to a similar event
in the future. And then this 70% may buy a ticket for the next real-time event. In other words, it is **"snowball
success"**. And on top of that, get another pleasant bonus: promote your event even after you finish live streaming.
Make full use of your old stream’s new views and convert them from one-time events to recurring sales and marketing
tools. Watch your old content recruit new viewers for future streaming events!

And last but not least, when choosing a LIVE4 subscription, you only pay a small monthly fee and for that you can
stream all you want! There are no additional payments for content posted to Facebook groups, pages or private accounts.
Viewers can continually revisit old events at no added cost to you, so streams keep paying market access dividends
while you pay nothing more! Plus, by allowing your viewers to watch live streams for free on Facebook, you will
automatically reach out to even more people than if you charged per view.
